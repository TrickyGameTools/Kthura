(If you see this file on Github, well ignore it, then nothing in this document applies to you. It's simply here, because that's easier to update).

The repository on Bitbucket is merely a direct clone of the repository on Github. It's therefore pretty easy for me to keep both repositories up to date :)
A few notes are in order, though if you prefer BitBucket over GitHub.

- GitHub is the prime location of this repository. You can always be sure the repo on GitHub is up-to-date. The same cannot always be said about the version on BitBucket, although I'll try to keep it up to-to-date.
- The folder where the Kthura Text Editor is located will always link to GitHub even when you access this repository on BitBucket, and not I am not gonna change that. The text editor is a utility on its own, and I tend to only make 
my bigger projects available on multiple sites, and the text editor is not one of those projects. Second, the text editor is linked in this repo by means of a submodule, and I really don't know if submodules even support it to have 
it link on BitBucket here and on Github on the github repo, and frankly, I don't even care at this point, as I would very likely not have resorted to submodules in the first place if I was really caring about that.
- Issues can only be posted on the GitHub repository. Sorry, but I ain't gonna trace TWO issue trackers. Furthermore, the issue numbers in commit messages will refer to the issue tracker on GitHub and their respective numbers 
there. The same goes for pull requests.
- Speaking of pull requests, they are still possible to make on BitBucket, since this is a full clone, I can probably merge them in just as easily as I can do that on Github (nothing someone says before the word "but" really 
counts), BUT, keep in mind that I will very likely get to see your pull request SOONER when you send it to Github, also increasing the chance that when I review it, it doesn't conflict with earlier commits (since the GitHub version 
is always up-to-date, remember, and since I basically visit GitHub everyday I am in a coding seesion, I will also see the notifications sooner, decreasing the change I made modifications that can cause incompatibility issues). I 
will not forbid making pull requests through BitBucket, but if any pull requests that causes conflicts with my current commits, will very likely be rejected, no matter how good it is (conflict solving ain't that easy with 
version-control tools such as git, and I wish to avoid doing that as much as possible).
- Releases are primarily sent to GitHub only. Well tht goes at least for early access releases and minor updates. Major updates and initial stable releases *may* be released on BitBucket as well, but it's NEVER a promise. In other 
words, on BitBucket there is a risk for outdated versions. Never forget that.
- The wiki will only be posted on Github.
