Kthura uses multiple applications to form one big software package for you to enjoy!

### Note about the Text Editor.

The Kthura Text Editor is an optional tool, linked as a submodule. You can easily live without it, and the launcher won't even link to it. The installer script will include this tool though and add it to the start module. It is technically part of the Kthura package, but a completely different kind of tool, and most users should not even touch it. The tool is for expert Kthura users only to manually tweak a few things a WYSIWYG editor may not be able to cover properly. If you don't know how Kthura works "under the hood", the tool can be dangerous, and better be left alone. :P
